## Major Learning Goals/Code Review

<!-- Instructors: Feel free to practice creating specific feedback by referencing a line of code if you'd like. For example, you may say something like "nice custom method in `calculator.rb` line 42." This is optional. -->

| Criteria | yes/no, and optionally any details/lines of code to reference |
| --- | --- |
| Correctly creates, reads, and modifies variables | ✔️
| Correctly creates and accesses arrays | ✔️
| Correctly creates and accesses hashes | ✔️
| Reasonably organizes large amounts of related data into nested arrays and hashes | ✔️
| Correctly iterates through a nested data structure using loops and/or Enumerable methods | ✔️
| Reasonably organizes small pieces of code into methods, and calls/invokes those methods | ✔️

## Functional Requirements

| Functional Requirement | yes/no |
| --- | --- |
| To the terminal, the program outputs the correct number of rides each driver has given | ✔️
| ... outputs the total amount of money each driver has made | ✔️
| ... outputs the average rating for each driver | ✔️
| ... outputs which driver made the most money | ✔️
| ... outputs which driver has the highest average rating | ✔️

<!-- Answer Key:

Driver amount of rides
Driver 1: 3
Driver 2: 3
Driver 3: 2
Driver 4: 3

Total amount earned by each driver
Driver 1: $85
Driver 2: $75
Driver 3: $55
Driver 4: $35

The average rating of Driver 1 is 3.0
The average rating of Driver 2 is 3.0
The average rating of Driver 3 is 3.5
The average rating of Driver 4 is 4.67

The driver who made the most money: Driver 1.
The driver with the highest rating is Driver 4.

Driver 1 made the most money on 5th Feb 2016
Driver 2 made the most money on 5th Feb 2016
Driver 3 made the most money on 5th Feb 2016
Driver 4 made the most money on 5th Feb 2016
