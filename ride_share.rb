# Step 1: Establish the layers

# In this section of the file, as a series of comments,
# create a list of the layers you identify.
# Which layers are nested in each other?
# Which layers of data "have" within it a different layer?
# Which layers are "next" to each other?
    #at the top is all the trips
    #next layer down is each driver
    #next layer under each driver is each trip they did
    #each trip for each driver will be next to each other in the innermost layer
    #each driver will be next to each other in the middle layer
    #the "umbrella" layer holds everything from the middle and innermost layer inside of it


########################################################
# Step 2: Assign a data structure to each layer

# Copy your list from above, and in this section
# determine what data structure each layer should have
    #outer most layer is an array that will hold all the info
    #middle layer will be of hashes that belong to each individual driver
    #inside the hash of each indiv. driver, there is a hash for each trip

########################################################
# Step 3: Make the data structure!

# Setup the entire data structure:
# based off of the notes you have above, create the
# and manually write in data presented in rides.csv
# You should be copying and pasting the literal data
# into this data structure, such as "DR0004"
# and "3rd Feb 2016" and "RD0022"

#Step 4: Total Driver's Earnings and Number of Rides

## Iterate through the data structure to display, by printing in terminal, the following info:
## - The number of rides each driver has given
## - The total amount of money each driver has made
## - The average rating for each driver
## - Which driver made the most money?
## - Which driver has the highest average rating?
## You may create and/or use as many variables, loops, and methods as you need.
